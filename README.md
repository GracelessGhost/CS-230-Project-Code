# cs-230-project-code
 
This repository contains my code for the final project of Stanford's CS 230 - Deep Learning course.

The most relevant scripts that I wrote are:

* Format Data/formatData.m
* LSTM Approach/model.m
* UnEye Approach/UnEye.ipynb

I also modified the architecture code in UnEye Approach/uneye/classifier.py
