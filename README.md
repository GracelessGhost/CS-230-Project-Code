# deep-saccade-detection

An LSTM network and a convolutional neural network designed to classify eye movements as saccades vs. non-saccades.
 
Final project of Stanford's CS 230 - Deep Learning course.

The most relevant scripts that I wrote are:

* Format Data/formatData.m
* LSTM Approach/model.m
* UnEye Approach/UnEye.ipynb

I also modified the architecture code in UnEye Approach/uneye/classifier.py
